##The following is written by Savanna van Mesdag, going through the relevant coding and analyses for the biodiversity analyses for the six anthropogenic substrate study sites.

#setwd#

#To run the following code to carry out the analyses, the following packages must be installed#

```{R}

install.packages("vegan", repos = "	https://github.com/vegandevs/vegan")

install.packages("labdsv", repos = "https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=labdsv")

```

##The packages also need to be loaded prior to running the analyses#
```{R}

library(vegan)
library(labdsv)

```

#Loading the datasets for the Barrow plant communities and substrate data...

```{R}
urlfile1 <- 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Savannankvm/Indval-Analyses-for-Barrow-Plant-and-Substrate-Data/PhD-files/BarrowPlantSpecies_with_site_names.csv'

BarrowSpecies <-read.csv(urlfile1 , row.names = 1)

urlfile2 <- 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Savannankvm/Indval-Analyses-for-Barrow-Plant-and-Substrate-Data/PhD-files/BarrowPlantChemistry_with_site_names.csv'

BarrowChemistry <-read.csv(urlfile2 , row.names = 1)

```

#Now to convert the files to dataframes for analyses

```{R}

BarrowSpecies1 <- data.frame(BarrowSpecies)

BarrowChemistry1 <- data.frame(BarrowChemistry)

```

##Running an Indval analysis with Quartz as the substrate#
